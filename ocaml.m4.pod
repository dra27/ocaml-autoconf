ocaml.m4 - Autoconf macros for OCaml

=head1 SUMMARY

 AC_PROG_OCAML
 AC_PROG_FINDLIB
 AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG([extlib])

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ocaml.m4> is a file containing standard, useful autoconf macros for
detecting OCaml, findlib, OCaml packages and so on in your
autoconf-generated configure scripts.

To begin using these macros, you will need to copy the C<ocaml.m4>
file to the autoconf macros directory in your project.  Normally this
is the C<m4/> directory in your project, but the directory can be
changed using the C<AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR(DIR)> directive.

You can then add any of the macros described below to your
C<configure.ac> (or C<configure.in>).  Almost every OCaml project
should use C<AC_PROG_OCAML> first and probably C<AC_PROG_FINDLIB>
right after it.

This manual page does not describe how to use autoconf.  For that you
should read the detailed autoconf info file (C<info autoconf>).

=head1 AC_PROG_OCAML

This macro detects whether the OCaml compiler(s) are available.  It
defines and substitutes the following variables:

 OCAMLC          set to the name of the bytecode compiler
                   (eg. "ocamlc" or "ocamlc.opt"), or "no" if
                   no OCaml installation was found
 OCAMLOPT        the name of the native-code compiler, eg. "ocamlopt",
                   "ocamlopt.opt" or "no"
 OCAMLBEST       "byte" or "opt" or "no"
 OCAMLDEP        the name of the dependency resolver, eg. "ocamldep"
 OCAMLLIB        the OCaml library path
 OCAMLVERSION    the compiler version

=head2 Detecting if OCaml is installed

Unlike old versions of these macros, C<AC_PROG_OCAML> does I<not> exit
if no OCaml installation is detected.  Therefore if you want to detect
if OCaml is installed you have to do something like this:

 AC_PROG_OCAML
 if test "$OCAMLC" = "no"; then
   AC_MSG_ERROR([You must install the OCaml compiler])
 fi

=head2 Cross-compiling

If the configure script is invoked for cross-compiling then
C<AC_PROG_OCAML> will detect the cross-compiler versions of the OCaml
compiler, eg. C<OCAMLC=i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlc> etc.  This
happens automatically, and for most purposes you don't need to worry
about it.
